# FootballManager

   This is a fantasy-league like project where you can create your own team and participate in leagues and tournaments with other people. It's luck-based, meaning that teams or players don't have statistics. Additionally, there is an automated league and tournament every week. Although you can't join them, you can participate by betting on the winning team of a match, the league or the tournament.
